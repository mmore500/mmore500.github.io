abstract: |
  Empirical is a C++ library designed to promote open science and facilitate the development of scientific software that is efficient, reliable, and easily distributable to researchers and non-experts alike.
  Specifically, the library sets out to fulfill the following goals:

  1. Utility: Empirical tools streamline common scientific computing tasks such as configuration, end-to-end data management, and mathematical manipulations.
  2. Efficiency: Empirical implements general-purpose data structures and algorithms that emphasize computational efficiency to support scientific computing workloads.
  3. Reliability: Empirical provides sophisticated debug-mode instrumentation including audited memory management and safety-checked versions of standard library containers.
  4. Distributability: Empirical is highly portable, uses common data formats, and facilitates compile-to-web app development with object-oriented bindings for Emscripten/WebAssembly GUI elements, all with the goal of building broadly accessible scientific software.
