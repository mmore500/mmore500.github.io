abstract: |
  Developing software to effectively take advantage of growth in parallel and distributed processing capacity poses significant challenges.
  Best-effort computing models, which relax synchronization requirements, have been proposed as a strategy to overcome challenges harness high performance computing at extreme scale.
  Although many programming languages and frameworks aim to facilitate software development for high performance applications, existing prevalent tools do not expose an explicit best-effort interface.
  The Conduit C++ Library aims to provide a convenient interface for best-effort inter-thread and inter-process communication.
  Here, we describe the motivation, objectives, design, and implementation of the library.
