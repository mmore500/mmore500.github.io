venue: Enriching Scholarship Conference
abstract: |
  Session participants will walk through an interactive, zero-code tutorial demonstrating how to create and manage a public-facing class blog using the Jekyll site framework and GitHub pages.
  We will also discuss milestone-based project structure to guide students to successful project completion and authorial strategies to create engaging scholarly web-based content.

  After this session, participants will be equipped to:
  1. create a Jekyll-based class blog on GitHub pages,
  2. guide student authorship of engaging scholarly blog posts that incorporate Markdown-based styling and multimedia elements,
  3. structure a milestone-based deadline schedule to help students stay on track for successful preparation of a high-quality written work,
  4. facilitate student peer review using GitHub pull requests, and
  5. streamline student submission of draft milestones and final piece for publication using pull request status labels.

  The majority of the session will consist of a guided tutorial experience in which participants will create mock blog posts and engage in a mock peer review process.
  These activities will be fully accessible to participants on any platform, including mobile devices, through browser-based interfaces.
  No coding will be required.
