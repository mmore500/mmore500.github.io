abstract: |
  We introduce and experimentally demonstrate the utility of tag-based genetic regulation, a new genetic programming (GP) technique that allows programs to dynamically adjust which code modules to express.
  Tags are evolvable labels that provide a flexible mechanism for referencing code modules.
  Tag-based genetic regulation extends existing tag-based naming schemes to allow programs to “promote” and “repress” code modules in order to alter expression patterns.
  This extension allows evolution to structure a program as a gene regulatory network where modules are regulated based on instruction executions.
  We demonstrate the functionality of tag-based regulation on a range of program synthesis problems.
  We find that tag-based regulation improves problem-solving performance on context-dependent problems; that is, problems where programs must adjust how they respond to current inputs based on prior inputs.
  Indeed, the system could not evolve solutions to some context-dependent problems until regulation was added.
  Our implementation of tag-based genetic regulation is not universally beneficial, however.
  We identify scenarios where the correct response to a particular input never changes, rendering tag-based regulation an unneeded functionality that can sometimes impede adaptive evolution.
  Tag-based genetic regulation broadens our repertoire of techniques for evolving more dynamic genetic programs and can easily be incorporated into existing tag-enabled GP systems.
