  bI/O is a prison seminar outreach program coordinated by scientists at the University of Michigan to engage with the Parnall Correctional Facility in Jackson, MI.
  We work with prison officials to schedule sessions 2-3 times per semester.
  Each session, a panel of 3 researchers present a 15-20 minute talk about their science and career path in a seminar-style format.
  Organizers workshop presentation materials with presenters to make sure it is accessible and follows the strict guidelines of the correctional facility.
  After the talks, we open up for a discussion panel where incarcerated students will be able to ask us further questions about science, careers, etc.
