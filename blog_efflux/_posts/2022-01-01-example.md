abstract: |
  Begun in 1988, the human genome project intends to map the 23 chromosomes that provide the blueprint for the human species.
  The project has both scientific and ethical goals.
  The scientific goals underscore the advantages of the genome project, including identifying and curing diseases and enabling people to select the traits of their offspring, among other opportunities.
  Ethically, however, the project raises serious questions about the morality of genetic engineering.
  To handle both the medical opportunities and ethical dilemmas posed by the genome project, scientists need to develop a clear set of principles for genetic engineering and to continue educating the public about the genome project.
