  This website pulls directly from publicly available Gw███tt County Public Schools (GCPS) data.
  As the data on the website are provided as discrete pdf files per day, it can be difficult to see patterns.
  This website therefore serves as a way to visualize the data for interested stakeholders.
  This requires data to be scraped from PDF reports (now also located here) put together by the Gw███tt School District, packaged with a shiny web app, and deployed to https://shinyapps.io.
  We also automatically upload up-to-date consolidated datasets to the project's Open Science Framework page.
