TODO under construction

I spent a lot of this last weekend aspirationally re-upping my vim game.
That's what there is to do for fun nowadays, I guess.
Maybe I'll actually stick to it this time.

Characteristically, I spent too long fiddling with things that don't matter.

`blink.sh` is great to attach to a remote server (with pretty colors and cool remappings) but what about when we're offline?
We can use `ish` to run a ssh server with an Alpine linux environment and then connect to it with blink.

from the ish side:
```
apk add python3 git zsh shadow ncurses perl curl openssh openrc vim nvim
adduser user
ssh-keygen -A

# this way we can run it in the background, although this is a bit too laggy
# running ish and blink.sh side by side gets the most responsive results
# //https://github.com/ish-app/ish/issues/249#issuecomment-544338096
cat /dev/location > /dev/null &
/usr/sbin/sshd -d -p 8000
```

Get blink.sh things set up to be pretty
`Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> Hardware Keyboard -> Modifier Keys`
[https://github.com/hwyncho/Nord-Blink](https://github.com/hwyncho/Nord-Blink)

from the blink side:
```
ssh -p 8000 user@localhost
```

(answer yes then no, when you reinstall ish it will have a new key, blink will freak out, and it's hard to fix)

too slow/wonky for my full zsh setup, but with some plugins disabled vim is manageable
