I spent a lot of this last weekend aspirationally re-upping my vim game.
That's what there is to do for fun nowadays, I guess.
Maybe I'll actually stick to it this time.

Characteristically, I spent too long fiddling with things that don't matter.
In particular, I really tweaked out over git diff symbols in the gutter.

I felt that the the default `+` and `-` symbols don't efficiently show the
spatial structure of the diffs they represented.
I addressed this by using full-width underscore elements for the deletion diffs (where the deleted lines are just below) and a mirrored L shape for the deletion plus modification diffs (representing changes to the focal line in addition to deletion below).

I also felt the diff symbols lacked visual weight necessary to make their color coding pop.
I fixed this by prepending the diff symbols with a full-character box.

Anyways, I spent long enough combing through the ASCII character set and playing
with different options figured it might be worth a share.
Here's a screen grab example of the gutter diff symbols I eventually settled on in action.

![The gutter symbols in action.](/resources/vim-gitgutter-example.jpg){:width="100%"}

Here's the relevant `.vimrc` bits for your copy/paste pleasure.

```
let g:gitgutter_sign_added = '‚ñà|'
let g:gitgutter_sign_modified = '‚ñà‚´∂'
let g:gitgutter_sign_removed = '‚ñà‚ñÅ'
let g:gitgutter_sign_removed_first_line = '‚ñà‚ñî'
let g:gitgutter_sign_modified_removed = "‚ñà‚ñü"
```

.vimrc!
