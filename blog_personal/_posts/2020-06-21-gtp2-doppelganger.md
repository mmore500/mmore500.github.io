*All fun shenanigans described here were undertaken in a purely personal capacity.*
*This endeavor is **not** a professional activity associated with my role in any lab/institution or any funding/support I receive.*

As you do from time to time, I recently stumbled upon an anonymous, and often political, twitter asshole.
This persona was preoccupied generating 100% USDA certified tool content, but (much to my own chagrin, as pretentious a prick as he was) I had to admit somewhat admired his wit.

To protect the anonymity of everyone involved, I've decided against embedding any material here or linking back.
(But if I know you & you're curious, DM me.)

I ruminated on the best way to:
1. tell this guy off for being a tool while
2. not being a tool myself and
3. denying him the satisfaction of a last word.

I figured it had to be something entertaining and strange.
Why not point out how self-involved & disconnected from reality his account was by using machine learning to impersonate him?
Sounded like a fun weekend to me.

## Scrape Some Data

The first step, or course, was scraping [@Mottl](https://github.com/Mottl)'s [GetOldTweets3](https://github.com/Mottl/GetOldTweets3) tool made this pretty easy --- no API key required.

Then I just ran a quick python script to make a training data set out of the scraped data.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("output_got.csv")
with open('training_data.txt', 'w') as f:
  for tweet in df["text"].dropna():
    f.write(str(tweet))
    f.write("\n==========\n")
```

## Bake that Sucker

Pop a model in the oven using some nice [copy-paste code from Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-make-a-gpt2-twitter-bot-8669df60e60a).

If you don't have your own GPU sitting around, you can [rent GPU time](https://blog.thedataincubator.com/2018/04/gpu-cloud-computing-compared/) for not too much nowadays.

## Rough Diamonds

This might not be as funny without being familiar with the source account, but `Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯`.

## Window Dressing

Scraping down the target's profile picture your browser's developer view.
(Usually `ctrl-shift-i`.)
Load up their profile and monitor images that are loaded up in the Network view.

[Google voice](https://voice.google.com/) is a good way to get a semi-anonymous phone number to set up a semi-anonymous parody account.
(You can get doxed by the four or so digits of the phone number that are displayed on the password reset button.)

## An Art

My initial take was to generate a bunch of tweets and schedule them to post on the parody account.
This was fun for a while.

Then I played around with joining in on twitter conversations the target account had been involved in, but this got me blocked.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/msubroad?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@msubroad</a> please make my week &amp; hang a bathroom stall door in your gallery space <a href="https://t.co/gTYl8INEC8">https://t.co/gTYl8INEC8</a></p>&mdash; mmore500 (@mmore500) <a href="https://twitter.com/mmore500/status/1224068365729157120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2020</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Who would have guessed that my initial, finely-tuned artistic instincts could have been too aggressive.

## Retweet

I regrouped and settled on a doppelganger format where I retweet the target adding a generated comment seeded on the first few words of the original tweet.
I made a second account to try this out and, so far, at least haven't got blocked yet.

Here's an example of what this looks like, with a bot trained on Drumpf.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I gave John Bolton, who was incapable of being Senate confirmed because of his stupid line of reasoning, a little more money to help him win the White House. This is a disaster for American families! <a href="https://t.co/XktWcStgOu">https://t.co/XktWcStgOu</a></p>&mdash; mmore500 (@mmore500) <a href="https://twitter.com/mmore500/status/1275245909761069057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 23, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This could format could be adjusted to be slightly more invasive by commenting on the original tweets.

## Keeping up with the Kardiashians

The ideal way to set up this type of system would be as a completely autonomous bot.

However, while I've been playing around with the concept I've just been running the parody account manually.
[Zapier](https://zapier.com/)'s tweet to email service provides a nice, discreet way to keep up with the target's tweets.
I think you could also set up twitter to notify you whenever someone specific you're following tweets.

## But is it Ethical?

Probably not `Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯`.
I guess my real question is, how unethical is it?

Some questions for small-group discussion:
* At what point is this just harassment?
* If you're mimicking a horrible account, at which point are you just tweeting more horrible things.
* By following the parody account are you just setting yourself up to be Stockholm syndrome-d to all the horrible things.

## Future Work if I Feel Like It

![A quality certificate](/resources/gtp2-doppelganger-certificate.jpg){:width="100%"}

With my glorious Certificate of Twitter Achievement in hand from [@leg2015](https://twitter.com/leg2015), the future is a bright vista spread before me!
At least while I play around with this project for another week and then forget about it.

Until then, here's what I'm thinking about:
* automation
  * how to automatically select seed text?
  * how to automatically select generated text among alternate options to maximize entertainment value?
  * how to automatically screen out truly horrible, unconscionable things from generated text?
    (I've already had to do this a few times manually.)
* better model
  * especially RE: working with seed text, where gpt-2 doesn't seem to fare particularly well
  * how much to train the model and what "temperature" (zaniness) parameter settigns to use
    * if the model mimics the target without being slightly absurd, it's not too entertaining
* bigger, more public target
  * probably someone political with a distinctive twitter personality would be a good choice

## Let's Chat!

What future directions should I take this project in?
What tools or techniques should I consider using?
What is *your* critical interpretation of this piece?

I started a twitter thread (right below) so we can chat :phone: :phone: :phone:
