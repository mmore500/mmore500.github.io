The undersigned will be ceasing our workshop activities related to the [WAVES Workshop](https://github.com/mmore500/waves) on Wednesday, June 10th in support of [#ShutDownAcademia](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShutDownAcademia), [#ShutDownSTEM](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShutDownSTEM), and the [Black Lives Matter movement](https://blacklivesmatter.com/).
To this end, I will no longer be presenting the [Enrichment Seminar](https://mmore500.com/waves/discussion/week2.html) planned for that day.
The undersigned encourage [WAVES Workshop](https://github.com/mmore500/waves) mentors and participants to consider suspending their own meetings and development work.

## Materials

The undersigned encourage [WAVES Workshop](https://github.com/mmore500/waves) mentors and participants to instead consider engaging with conversations and materials related to the [Black Lives Matter movement](https://blacklivesmatter.com/).
We have collected a few here, but suggest that mentees and participants also seek out their own.
