I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) associated with the [Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department](https://lsa.umich.edu/eeb) and the [Complex Systems](https://lsa.umich.edu/cscs/) and [Michigan Institute for Data Science](https://midas.umich.edu/) programs.
I am a member of the [Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.schmidtfutures.com/our-work/schmidt-ai-in-science-postdocs/) program.
My research interest is in using digital evolution techniques to investigate scientific questions about evolution.
I currently study major transitions in evolution and evolvability.

Previously, I was a doctoral student at the [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/) in both the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.msu.edu/) and the [Ecology and Evolutionary Biology program](https://eebb.msu.edu/).
I worked with the [Digital Evolution Lab](http://devolab.msu.edu/), led by [Dr. Charles Ofria](http://www.ofria.com/), and was associated with the [BEACON Center for Evolution in Action](http://beacon-center.org/).

I grew up in Corvallis, Oregon then moved to Tacoma, Washington to attend the [University of Puget Sound](https://www.pugetsound.edu/).
In 2017, I graduated as a Coolidge Otis Chapman Honors Scholar with majors in Mathematics and Computer Science and a minor in Chemistry.
My undergraduate thesis and capstone work, respectively, investigated theoretical aspects of evolvability and probed the relationship between evolvability and plasticity through computational experimentation.
[Dr. America Chambers](http://mathcs.pugetsound.edu/~alchambers/) served as my thesis advisor.

In my spare time, I like to take pictures.
You can look at a few of them [here](http://mmore500.tumblr.com).
I particularly love the green spaces around Corvallis, which appear frequently in my photographs.
As an undergraduate, I played oboe with the University of Puget Sound Wind Ensemble and tutored at the [Center for Writing, Learning, and Teaching](https://www.pugetsound.edu/cwlt).
I also wrote for the University of Puget Sound Sound Economics Blog, which you can read [here](https://blogs.pugetsound.edu/econ/).
