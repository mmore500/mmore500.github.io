title: "Academic Social Media By Example"
date: 2019-11-17
---

:warning: :construction: WORKING DRAFT, UNDER CONSTRUCTION!  :construction: :warning:

When I first dipped my toes into the academic circles of social media (e.g., twitter), I was shocked --- and, to be honest, quite intimidated --- by the breadth of the oeuvre.
I saw academics using social media in many clever ways to dizzyingly diverse ends.
(It's not just for disseminating preprint links!?!?!)
I began to realize: effectively using professional social media requires more skill than hanging up posters in an elevator or announcing a talk on the list serv.
So, over the course of a few years, I started tucking away enlightening specimens from my news feeds, academic and otherwise.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Media Manager: Okay, what is something quick we can do to interact on social media and show we are active and can be fun?<br><br>Intern #1: Just mash all the keys on the keyboard and tweet it, they&#39;ll love it</p>&mdash; (not champs) Dragon (@dragonsjet) <a href="https://twitter.com/dragonsjet/status/1067830411869380608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Now, I've organized them here.
By example, we will survey types and techniques of interaction on academic social media.
I hope that surveying academic social media will new ideas for ends and toolbox with the nuts and bolts to be effective.
Buckle up!

## Why Even Use Social Media as an Academic?

I suspect that if you clicked through and read this far, you don't need convincing on this front.
So, I broke this section out into a separate post [elsewhere on my blog](/2019/11/16/why-tweet.html).

The primary point I push there is that developing a widespread following or generating viral content go viral are orthogonal (not particularly aligned with nor contrary to) many of the professional objectives of academics on social media.
Instead, I've found it's more helpful to focus on connecting to just a few of the *right* people.

## Why a Bestiary?

Esoteric philosophical bullshit alert! :rotating_light: :poop: :rotating_light:

I made this section collapsible on purpose.
Skip it if you just want to get to the good stuff.

<button class="collapsible" id="drivel">I Consent To Liberal Arts Drivel</button>
<div class="content" id="driveldata" markdown="1">
In his book *Evolution for Everyone*, evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson decomposes religion into "horizontal" and "vertical" components in order to analyze its role with respect to human social groups.
In this scheme, vertical components of a religion describe a believer’s relation to a higher power while horizontal components refer to how believers relate with one another and the world around them.
This distinction enables Wilson to pursue a fruitful analysis of religion guided by the question "what does it cause people to do?".
I will argue that we should observe an equivalent distinction between "vertical" and "horizontal" components of academic social media activity and, in particular, focus on the "horizontal."

At this point, let's meet Terence Koh.
I would describe Terence Koh as "The New York times describes Terence Koh as an '[art-world darling](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/11/arts/design/terence-koh-nothingtoodoo-at-mary-boone-review.html).'"

Here he is.
Read the caption.

<div class="tumblr-post" data-href="https://embed.tumblr.com/embed/post/yqtZ993HunTv3xP3Hm_frw/21659523406" data-did="43b839c8467df252a3e1704a036644572aec66aa"><a href="http://www.humansofnewyork.com/post/21659523406/one-of-my-favorite-responses-to-date-whats-in">http://www.humansofnewyork.com/post/21659523406/one-of-my-favorite-responses-to-date-whats-in</a></div>  <script async src="https://assets.tumblr.com/post.js"></script>

Terence Koh certainly dresses and acts the part of the "art-world darling."
To an extent, Terence Koh *is* an "art-world darling" *because* he dresses and acts the part.
In fact, Terence Koh even appears to *live* or maybe even *be* the part
(i.e., in his perfectly monochromatic house).

![Inside Terence Koh's House](/img/twitter-terence-koh.jpg){:width="100%"}
*Still from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nnewYDC69I).
See also [here](https://trendland.com/inside-terence-kohs-all-white-world/).*

It becomes difficult to avoid circling back to the question, "To what extent is his artistic persona intentionally constructed?"
That is, does he intentionally act the part of a idiosyncratic artist in order to sell his art?
Or does he sell his art for top dollar because he *intrinsically* performs the mannerisms of the idiosyncratic artist?

Analyzing rhetoric on academic twitter inevitably prompts parallel questions.
By its very essence, social media involves notions of persona, authenticity, and intent.
Unfortunately, interrogating users' rhetoric can therefore seem to involve uncomfortable ad hominem insinuations.
For example, we might remark on the rhetorical question posed in the following tweet.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Saw a neat miniature reconstruction of a Greek symposium yesterday. Can you imagine if seminar rooms were set up like this ? <a href="https://t.co/fbwkv0hCCq">pic.twitter.com/fbwkv0hCCq</a></p>&mdash; Marissa G. Croft (@mgcroft) <a href="https://twitter.com/mgcroft/status/1195697324598550528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The "horizontal" component of Wilson's dichotomic framework screens away the question of intent in favor of questions of function.
It avoids the nebulous and potentially uncomfortable, "What was Marissa's intent in posing a question that doesn't really have an answer?" in favor of a more impersonal, "How does the rhetorical question affect how viewers interpret and respond to the tweet?"

Intent is uncomfortable, inscrutable, and unactionable.
To learn how to sell our own gold-plated feces for hundreds of thousands of dollars, we should look past it.
The bestiary format of this blog post follows directly: decontextualizing specimens of academic twitter facilitates detached, pragmatic inquiry focused on functionality.

## Be a Community Asset

Effective users of academic media balance activity directly promoting themselves with activity facilitating community interactions.
Although this work seems (in an immediate sense) altruistic, it organically grows a user's set of connections, and perhaps even engenders more favorable perceptions among existing connections, for when it is time to trot out that link for the new preprint.
Plus, it does benefit the community.

### Facilitate Community Interactions

Make introductions, set up a nexus for others to find each other, or catalyze free-form chit chat.

### Appeal to Community

Ask the community directly for something or couch your message in terms of the benefit of the community.

### Be a Positive Influence

Big or small, call out an issue, advocate for something better, lend support or suggestions to changemakers, and be seen doing it.

### Send Someone a Compliment

If you appreciate a cool person's cool thing, let them know!
Using a public venue like twitter instead of a private channel like an email lets everyone else see the cool person's cool thing (and see you being friendly).
Also, if you don't already know the cool person, this is a super effective, non-spammy way to introduce yourself to someone new and, done right, it leaves them with a mental association between you and a positive experience.

### Collect Data

Gather information from the community that you can then turn around and present back to the community.
Link out to your own survey or use Twitter's [built-in functionality for basic polls](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-polls).
Bonus points to [@tonynorthrup](https://twitter.com/tonynorthrup) for cleverly using a single custom url to redirect first to google poll and *then* to his video summarizing the results of the poll.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m curious about people&#39;s thoughts/usage of pre-print servers.

### Just Ask a Question

Efforts to gather information from across the community need not be strictly quantitative.
Consider posing your question not just as something that you want to know for your own sake, but something that the others in the community could benefit from information on or that the community as a whole could benefit by discussing .

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is a disappointingly common problem in classics, thanks to both early scholars and (somehow worse) current researchers.

### Use the Screen Name

You can temporarily change your profile name to announce your presence at a community event.

![Jake Fenton changed his username to Jake Fenton @ Codemash](/img/twitter-fenton-codesmash.png){:width="100%"}
[@highnoiseratio](https://twitter.com/highnoiseratio)

You can also set your screen name to show support a cause (e.g., 🏳️‍🌈, ✊, etc.).

### Share Links for Presentation Attendees

Consider putting your twitter handle in the slides so your audience knows where to look.

### Be a Reporter

Keep members of the community who aren't at the event in the loop and make everyone who is at the event feel seen.
Share a highlight quote, picture, or a general summary.

### Curate Peers' Feeds

In addition to the tweets you write yourself, Twitter's algorithm populates your follower's feeds with your retweets and likes.
Twitter tells your follower's they are seeing this additional content *because* you retweeted and liked it.
Twitter's content aggregation algorithm presents an opportunity to build positive reputation by helping to curate content for the community.
Consider following accounts that generate content user's in your social media circle might enjoy and then use retweets and likes to pass it along.
Be wary of volume, quality, and professionalism, though, and, in particular, remember that, in addition to retweets, your likes get passed along.

## Be Known (Favorably)

Rise and grind!
Putting in consistent effort, not just popping in and out for the highlights, helps build positive recognition.

### Complain

A good gripe is pleasing to the senses (like, say, a fine whine), especially if the topic grinds your gears *too*.
Be mindful here: staying relatable and using appropriate tone is key.

## Invite Engagement

Just like effective talks prompt audience members to make comments and ask questions, effective social media prompts viewers to engage with replies and shares.

### Make It a Question

Throw a question on to the end of your tweet.
Or, instead of just sharing something about yourself, reframe your content around the opportunity for *others* to share.
Then, getting the party started by answering your own question.

### Promise To Respond

Designate a window of time to treat a thread like a live chat.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey fellas - I&#39;ll be doing a Q&amp;A from Twitter later today talking &#39;bout the YIAY LIVE show this Sunday!

Kate Wagner (of [mcmansionhell.com](https://mcmansionhell.com/) fame) had [a super thread](https://twitter.com/mcmansionhell/status/1059883024140156930) where, for several hours, she responded to every comment with ancient Microsoft Clip Art but, unfortunately, it has since come down.

## Make It Easy and Interesting to Look At

Twitter helps here by enforcing brevity, but grabbing and holding attention still requires intentional effort.

### Summarize and Visualize

Don't just post a link and a title!
Summarize the main points of what you're sharing (maybe in a thread) and add graphics.
Bonus points: instead of linking to your preprint PDF, make a video or write a slick blog post and link to that instead.

### Use Vertical Space

Consider breaking your point into mini-paragraphs and separating them using whitespace.
Or, get more creative!

### Package It As A Meme

Memes aren't just spongebob screengrabs with superimposed text.
Twitter is full of text-only meme formats that are easy to play along with, no microsoft paint required.
Think of memes like haikus or limericks.
They define a framework into which you can insert almost any message you like.

### Change the Screen Name

My pal [@leg2015](https://twitter.com/leg2015) always has a festive, seasonally appropriate screen name.

> 🍁 Lauren Gilles 🍁

> 🎄Lauren Gilles 🎄

> 🍁Lauren  🍃Gilles 🍂

Also consider puns and clever "middle name" nicknames.

## Account Shenanigans

Consider the set of academics and the set of twitter accounts...
let's explore the [non-bijective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection,_injection_and_surjection) realms of the twitterverse.

### Account Takeover

Rotating account moderatorship gives volunteers a big outlet and ensures a constant stream of content.

### Make Another Personal Account

Break apart your web presence by theme or volume (e.g., frequency of posting and sharing).
Bonus points if your profile names are cleverly related.
Practical tip: your accounts will need to be registered to different email addresses, but --- if you use gmail --- addresses extended with a `+` will route to the prefix address.
For example, `example+twitter2@gmail.com` will route to `example@gmail.com`.

## Optimize for Eyeballs

Now, we arrive at some of the more nuts and bolts aspects of social media use.

### #Hashtags and @Mentions

These tools help users outside your immediate circle discover your content.

Generally, aim for hashtags with a medium-sized following: not too big (or you'll be lost in the mix) but big enough for some exposure.

Copy, copy, copy the hashtags (and mentions) you see others using

You can also tack on hashtags and mentions as a reply to the original tweet.

Balance the #hashtag and @mention use to maintain the readability (and non-spammy vibe) of your tweet.
Unless the *point* of the tweet is to act as a connective nexus... then go right ahead.

Using @mentions alerts others involved in your tweet (who might share it around) *and* helps other readers more easily track down exactly who you're talking about.

![put mentions in the middle](/img/twitter-mentions.jpg){:width="100%"}

Twitter handles tweets that start with an @mention in a special way (more like a direct message) so that fewer people see it.
So, unless that's what you're going after, try to avoid starting with an @mention.

Most conferences provide a suggested hashtag and/or an account to mention @.

Some hashtags are tied to particular days of the week, times of the year, or even one-off events.
This works kind of like [broadcast spawning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spawn_(biology)), where everybody synchronizes to simultaneously generate *and* consume content.

### Twitter Lists

TODO

### Pre-Hype and Post-Hype

Don't just tweet the preprint link when you it goes up on ArXiV!
Build up expectations by teasing it beforehand and put it back in the mix later on by retweeting yourself.
If you don't want to clutter your twitter back catalog (or you want to retweet it *again* later) you can delete these retweets later!
Also consider using retweet-with-a-comment to quote yourself in a new context or as a callback.

### Engage More Broadly

Believe it or not, there's more to the world than people who watch your presentations, cite your papers, or *might* cite your papers!
Consider expanding your network by engaging in other circles (for example, with users of your preferred programming languages, with members of your preferred pop culture fandom, with your local community, or with comrades of your particular academic career stage).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fellow Michiganders: tomorrow is the last day to register to vote in MI if you want to vote in the Nov election.

## ... Companionship?

The functional impact of tweets isn't always just on the readership.
Academics are people too [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Footnotes), so writing and sharing on social media can provide emotional and creative gratification to the author, too.
Support from peers is a valuable resource in hard and/or annoying moments.
The (creative?) act of thinking up something clever to say is satisfying, too.

Consider a separate, maybe private, account based on the volume and intensity of your shitposting.

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Don't mean or offensive... well, duh.

More subtly, if you see something mean or offensive, speak out but try not to be mean or offensive yourself.
This summer, a science humor account I follow put out a crude tweet that *clearly* crossed the line.
I saw a quite a few brief replies along the lines of "yikes," which help the author and members of the community coming across the content to understand that it is unacceptable.
I was impressed, also, by diplomatic replies that, in addition to urging that the post to be taken down, invited the author into a dialogue with the goal of facilitating a learning moment.

In more antagonistic situations, consider making the classy choice to block trolls instead of rolling around in the mud.

## The Final Frontier

Namely, Instragram, TikTok, SnapChat, and/or whatever the kids are using these days.

## Interactive Exercise

### Part 1

It's easy enough to survey what stands out in *your* particular corner of the twitterverse.

1. Go to `twitter.com/yourhandle/likes` and spend a minute paging through your own likes.
What kind of posts are there?
2. Spend a minute paging through your retweets.
Go to `twitter.com/yourhandle`.
Bring up the webpage search bar (on most computers, hit `ctrl-f`) and enter `You Retweeted`.
This may require a little manual scrolling to load content.
3. Finally, for some extra spice: page through someone else's likes and retweets.
Repeat the steps above, but with a colleague's twitter handle.

### Part 2

What was common among your most successful tweets?
  * topic?
  * format?
  * hashtags and mentions?
  * time of day?
  * day of the week?

Bonus points for making a spreadsheet or a R pipeline.

Extra bonus points for sharing your takeaways and a mash-up of your own greatest hits.

## Let's Chat

Surprise!
This section's also one last clever twitter idea: use an embedded tweet as a comments section for your blog.
It's a convenient, portable, and zero-maintentance solution.
It also (*very subtly*) hints to your readership that they can find you on twitter.
The downside is that comments won't render inline on your post (although there will be a little readout showing the number of people "talking about this").

Embedded tweets also work great to break up a wall of text with a quote or a meme from yourself, your friends, or your nemeses.
You can easily generate embed codes (html to copy paste into a blog post) for a tweet over at [https://publish.twitter.com/](https://publish.twitter.com/).

So, without further ado....

What do *you* think about academic social media?
Like?
Dislike?
What have you seen academic social media accomplish at its best?
What changes have you made to how you approach social media since you started?

I started a twitter thread (right below) so we can chat :phone: :phone: :phone:
