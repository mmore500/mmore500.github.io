    Open source software supercharges the rate of scientific progress and the applied praxis of those advances.
    Interdisciplinary fields like artificial life, which thrive due to contributions from those without formal training in computing such as biologists and mathematicians, especially benefit from published applications and software packages.

    Open source devleopment of research software holds core priority within my work, with particular emphasis on maximizing its broader usefullness to the broader community outside of its original context.
    Teaching and mentorship also constitues a core aspect of this work, empowering researchers with development capabilities and promoting best practices in the community.
    I led the 2020 and 2021 Workshop for Avida-ED Software Development, which paired 27 early-career participants mentored 10 week hands-on projects, most related to writing, testing, and documenting software.
    I have also mentored five undergraduates on scientific software development projects.

    Successful evolutionary search depends on the production of meaningful phenotypic variation that can be inherited by offspring.
    Without useful heritable variation evolution stagnates.
    The concept of evolvability describes a population's capacity to generate useful heritable phenotypic variation is  of evolvability.
    Different evolving systems can exhibit different degrees of evolvability.

    Natural systems, in particular, are usually considered to have a capability to continuously generate interesting variation compared to computational
    systems.
    Understanding --- and replicating -- the evolvability of natural evolution is an open problem in computational evolution research.

    Evolvability is desirable in artificial evolution systems for practical ends -- more evolvable systems will help evolutionary algorithms to tackle sophisticated problems more effectively and efficiently.
    Understanding evolvability is of great scientific interest for both evolutionary biologists and evolutionary computing researchers, not only for optimization but also with respect to questions related to the evolution of complexity and open-ended evolution.
