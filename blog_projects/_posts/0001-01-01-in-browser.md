  _Live execution log for DISHTINY web app._

  Although nominally open sourced, much scientific software is inaccessible in practice because it is prohibitively difficult to use --- particularly for members of the general public.
  This software usually requires users to manually download and install the software, manage complicated software dependencies, and have familiarity with command-line interfaces.
  Browser-based software with an interactive GUI removes those barriers for both the public and for other scientists.

  The Empirical project unlocks the benefit potential of in-browser scientific software by providing a C++ interface to implement HTML GUIs that wrap the pre-existing research version of software, making it easier for researchers to keep the most recent version of scientific software available widely.

  Where possibles, I package my experiments & software with Empirical and publish them as interactive in-browser apps like [DISHTINY](https://mmore500.com/dishtiny).
  I also serve as a core contributor on the Empirical project, leading development of re-usable "prefabricated" GUI components and maintaining support for the Emscripten Web Worker API in the core library, among other responsibilities.
