  _Module expression snapshot in a DISHTINY case study._

  Genetic programming and artificial life systems commonly use tag matching to decide interactions between system components.
  However, the implications of criteria used to determine affinity between tags with respect evolutionary dynamics have not been directly studied.
  Mechanisms to allow reconfiguration of tag interactions at runtime through dynamic regulation remain unexplored, as well.

  This line of work explores how that tag-matching processes can influence the rate of adaptive evolution and the quality of evolved solutions.
  Better understanding of these processes will facilitate more effective incorporation of tag matching into genetic programming and artificial life systems.
  By showing that tag-matching processes influence connectivity patterns and evolutionary dynamics, our findings also raise fundamental questions about the properties of tag-matching systems in nature.
