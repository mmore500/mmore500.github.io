  _Illustration of selection for evolvability via modularly-varying fitness function._

  Biological organisms exhibit spectacular adaptation to their environments. However, another marvel of biology lurks behind the adaptive traits that organisms exhibit over the course of their lifespans: it is hypothesized that biological organisms also exhibit adaptation to the evolutionary process itself.
  Although a great deal of fruitful work has explored this idea of "evolvability," disparate and orthogonal definitions and explanations have splintered in the literature.

  This work pursues a review of evolvability theory and a unifying organization of theory, illustrated with examples and experiments from biology and evolutionary computing.
  It is hoped that a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of this aspect of evolution will translate to more powerful digital evolution techniques.
