  _Sequence of multicellular phenotypes observed in a DISHTINY experiment._

  Evolutionary transitions occur when previously-independent replicating entities unite to form more complex individuals.
  The necessary conditions and evolutionary mechanisms for these transitions to arise continue to be fruitful targets of scientific interest.
  Likewise, the relationship of such transitions to continuing generation of novelty, complexity, and adaptation remains an open question.

  This work uses a digital model of multicellularity to study a range of fraternal transitions in populations of open-ended self-replicating computer programs.
  These digital cells are allowed to form and replicate kin groups by selectively adjoining or expelling daughter cells.
  This model provides an opportunity study group-level traits that are characteristic of a fraternal transition.
  These include reproductive division of labor, resource sharing within kin groups, resource investment in offspring groups, asymmetrical behaviors mediated by messaging, morphological patterning, and adaptive apoptosis.

  Ongoing work with this model seeks to tease apart the interplay between novelty, complexity, and adaptation in evolution, with early results suggesting a loose, sometimes divergent, relationship.
