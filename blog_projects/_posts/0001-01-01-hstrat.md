  _Retention visualization for hereditary stratigraphy policy._

  The capability to detect phylogenetic cues within digital evolution has become increasingly necessary in both applied and scientific contexts. These cues unlock post hoc insight into evolutionary history --- particularly with respect to ecology and selection pressure --- but also can be harnessed to drive digital evolution algorithms as they unfold [CITE].
  However, parallel and distributed evaluation complicates, among other concerns, maintenance of an evolutionary record.
  Existing phylogenetic record keeping requires inerrant and complete collation of birth and death reports within a centralized data structure.
  Such perfect tracking approaches are brittle to data loss or corruption and impose communication overhead.

  A phylogenetic inference approach, as opposed to phylogenetic tracking, has potential to improve scalability and robustness.
  Under such a model, history is estimated from comparison of available extant genomes --- aligning with the familiar paradigm of phylogenetic work in wet biology.
  However, this raises the question of how best to design digital genomes to facilitate phylogenetic inference.

  This work introduces a new technique, called _hereditary stratigraphy_, that works by attaching a set of immutable historical "checkpoints" --- referred to as strata --- as an annotation on evolving genomes.
  Checkpoints can be strategically discarded to reduce annotation size at the cost of increasing inference uncertainty.
  An accompanying software library, `hstrat`, provides a plug-and-play implementation of hereditary stratigraphy that can be incorporated into any digital evolution system.
