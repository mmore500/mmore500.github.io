  _Visualization of rugged fitness landscape suited to denoising autoencoder genotype-phenotype map._

  In biology, phenotype refers to an organism’s observable characteristics (morphological, behavioral, physiological, chemical, etc.).
  Importantly, the phenotype governs an organism’s ability to survive and reproduce --- its fitness.
  Likewise, genotype refers to the heritable information that shapes an organism’s phenotype.
  This is typically equated with an organism’s DNA content.

  The genotype-phenotype map describes the relationship between an organism’s genotype and its phenotype.
  In biology, this concept is tightly entwined with the process of development, the dynamics through which an organism’s genotype and environment interact to determine its phenotype.
  As might be expected, the genotype-phenotype map profoundly influences the character of phenotypic variation that is produced under genetic mutation.

  Evolutionary search cannot succeed without the production of heritable, viable phenotypic variation, a trait referred to as evolvability.
  How to engineer genotype-phenotype maps to promote evolvability in digital evolution systems remains a crucial open question.

  This work introduces the use of bottlenecked and denoising autoencoders to automatically generate evolvable genotype-phenotype mappings.
  Autoencoders are algorithms that learn to regurgitate a particular type of input, usually implemented using deep learning.
  They allow for enhancement of evolvability due to their ability to repair poor-quality solutions and compactly represent the space of high-quality solutions.
