  _Cartoon illustration of communication between simulation elements in experiment with Conduit software._

  The parallel and distributed processing capacity of high-performance computing (HPC) clusters continues to grow rapidly and enable profound scientific and industrial innovations.
  These advances in hardware capacity and economy afford great opportunity, but also pose a serious challenge: developing approaches to effectively harness it.

  Software and hardware that relaxes guarantees of correctness and determinism --- a so-called ``best-effort model'' --- have been shown to improve speed.
  This work distills best-effort communication from the larger issue of best-effort computing.
  Specifically, we investigate the implications of relaxing synchronization and message delivery requirements.
  Such a best-effort approach meets the challenges of heterogenous, varying (i.e., due to power management), and generally lower communication bandwidth (relative to compute) expected on future HPC hardware.
  Notably, such a model presents the possibility of runtime adaptation to effectively utilize available resources given the particular ratio of compute and communication capability at any one moment in any one rack.

  Complex biological organisms exhibit characteristic best-effort properties: trillions of cells interact asynchronously while overcoming all but the most extreme failures in a noisy world.
  As such, bio-inspired algorithms present strong potential to benefit from best-effort communication strategies.

  Much exciting work on best-effort computing has incorporated bespoke experimental hardware.
  However, existing software libraries for traditional HPC hardware do not typically explicitly expose a convenient best-effort communication interface for such work.
  This work introduces the Conduit library, which facilitates best-effort communication between parallel and distributed processes on existing, commercially-available hardware.
