## Motivation

Suppose you have a `Cat` that can be in one of two modes: `Angel` and `Angry`.
For each state, you'd like to have a few actions that your cat can do: `.MakeSound()` and `.PlayWithToy()>s`.
In `Angel` mode, `Cat` needs to know which toys are available.
In `Angry` mode, `Cat` doesn't care --- `Cat` is not interested.
However, in `Angry` mode `Cat` needs to know the number of times its been asked to `.MakeSound()` --- after the third time, `Cat` will start making growls instead of meows.

We could model this situation with a `std::variant<Ts...>` (i.e., `std::variant<Angel, Angry>`).
However, when we switch modes any `Angel` state stored will be cleared out.
If we switch back to `Angel` mode, we won't know what toys are available!

We could have a `std::array<std::variant<Ts...>, len(Ts...)>`.
However, then we'd have to keep an index to track which mode is active.
This has a bit of extra overhead too --- we have to have `std::variant` machinery and the largest footprint of `Angel` or `Angry` in *every* element of the array.

We could have a `std::tuple<Ts...>` and maintain a runtime index.
If we didn't want to expose some kind of enum or indexing convention to the user, we'd have to do a bit of extra legwork.
Plus, runtime indexing into a `std::tuple<Ts...>` is generally not super cute.
Especially if we want to do a visitor pattern.

We could have a `std::tuple<Ts...>` and use a `std::variant<Ts...>` to keep track of what's active.
We could do a visitor pattern here, using `std::get<T>` to switch up which tuple element we operate with based on the active type in the variant.
But the overhead of maintaining a dummy `std::variant` of actual `Ts...` is not super cute.

We should have a `std::tuple<Ts...>` and use a `std::variant<std::type_identity<Ts>...>` to keep track of what's active.
Now that *is* supercute: `std::type_identity` is an empty type, so we can use the `std::variant` machinery to track active type with negligible overhead.

## Implementation

I've implemented this idea in the `DisjointVariant` class below: the idea is to provide similar functionality to `std::variant` but with state maintained (instead of cleared) for inactive modes.

```cpp
#include <tuple>
#include <type_traits>
#include <utility>
#include <variant>

template<typename ...Ts>
class DisjointVariant {

  // Holds state for each element.
  std::tuple<Ts...> disjoint_data;

  /// Tracks which type is active.
  std::variant<std::type_identity<Ts>...> active_typeid;

  public:

  /// Forwarding constructor.
  template<typename... Args>
  DisjointVariant(Args&&... args)
  : disjoint_data(std::forward<Args>(args)...)
  {}

  /// Switch which data element is active.
  template<typename T>
  void Activate() {
    using wrapped_active_type_t = std::type_identity<T>;
    active_typeid.template emplace<wrapped_active_type_t>();
  }

  /// Assign to data element.
  template<typename T>
  void AssignToElement(T&& val) {
    std::get<T>(disjoint_data) = std::forward<T>(val);
  }

  /// Assign data element and set that element as active.
  template<typename T>
  void AssignAndActivate(T&& val) {
    AssignToElement<T>( std::forward<T>(val) );
    Activate<T>();
  }

  /// Wraps std::visit to execute visitor on active data element.
  template<class Visitor>
  decltype(auto) Visit(Visitor&& visitor) {
    return std::visit(
      [this, &visitor]( const auto& typeid_ ){
        using wrapped_active_type_t = std::decay_t<decltype(typeid_)>;
        using active_type_t = typename wrapped_active_type_t::type;
        auto& active_data = std::get<active_type_t>( disjoint_data );
        return std::forward<Visitor>(visitor)(active_data);
      },
      active_typeid
    );
  }

};
```

## Example

To implement our `Cat` with `DisjointVariant` we could do something like...
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

struct Angel {

  std::string available_toy;

  void MakeSound() const { std::cout << "purr" << '\n'; }

  std::string PlayWithToy() const {
    if (available_toy == "mouse") return "pounce";
    else if (available_toy == "ball") return "bat";
    else return "sniff";
  }

};

struct Angry {

  size_t poke_count{};

  void MakeSound() {
    if (++poke_count < 3) std::cout << "meow" << '\n';
    else std::cout << "grr" << '\n';
  }

  std::string PlayWithToy() const { return "glare"; }

};

struct Cat {

  DisjointVariant<Angel, Angry> mode;

  void MakeSound() {
    mode.Visit([](auto&& impl){ impl.MakeSound(); });
  }

  std::string PlayWithToy() {
    return mode.Visit([](auto&& impl){ return impl.PlayWithToy(); });
  }

};
```
