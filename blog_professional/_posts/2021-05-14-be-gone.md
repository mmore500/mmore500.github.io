I consider myself a moderately fluent Pythonista --- I like to think I can decorate, iterate, & comprehend lists with the best of 'em.
However, organizing Python source --- especially for bigger projects --- has always been a major blind spot for me.
Due to Fear!!, Terror!!, Dread!!, and Severe Tilting!!! over cryptic, intransigent python import errors and [big long stackoverflow pages bereft of copy/paste miracle magic](https://stackoverflow.com/q/14132789) I've always just fallen back to keeping everything in a single monster scripts --- worse yet, duplicating everything across a wicked bramble of sibling script files.

Organizing and writing with a library mindset is the better way to go:
* source can be stored as small, digestible pieces with descriptive names,
* source can be reused better so there's less duplicated effort and [shotgun surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun_surgery), and
* source can be pampered with Good Practices like unit testing and formal documentation.

So, this year I've had a bit of a sit-down with myself to try to build some skills in this department with Python.
After rounding my usual miserable circuit of fruitless fiddling and googling, I clocked a new (to me) idea that finally helped me switch over to a library organization model for Python in my projects.

Before we get to my One Weird Trick, let me bore you with a brief description of my long-held project organization dream and

## My Dream KÃ∂iÃ∂tÃ∂cÃ∂hÃ∂eÃ∂nÃ∂ Project

Let's say that I'm working on a very swell codebase called `my_yeet_project`.
I'd like to be able to organize all my reusable python components into a single folder --- maybe called `yeetpylib/`.
I'm going to want to use these components from some Jupyter notebooks.
Lately, I've taken to shoving these all into a folder called `binder/` and hosting them via <https://mybinder.org>.
I usually also want to use these components from a variety of scripts that will be invoked directly from the command-line.
I'd like to organize them in a few folders named based on what they're actually used to do --- typically stuff along the lines of `postprocessing/` and the like.
I'll probably have a few non-python odds and ends (bash :roll_eyes:) living inside `postprocessing/` too.

Here's what a file tree for that project might look like.

```
my_yeet_project
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ binder
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cheuggy_graphs_n_stats.ipynb
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sheeshish_graphs_n_stats.ipynb
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ postprocessing
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gaggy_bash_shenanigans.sh
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sheesh_n_cheugify_data.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ yeetpylib
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ calculate_cheug.py
 ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ calculate_sheesh.py
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
```

## Why We Can't Have Nice Things

Wouldn't it be nice if we could just access `yeetpylib` by relative import from our scripts and notebooks, something like

`binder/cheuggy_graphs_n_stats.ipyhb` or `postprocessing/sheesh_n_cheugify_data.py`:
```python
import ..yeetpylib.calculate_cheug.cheugrify
```

Wouldn't it, indeed.
:thinking:

Unfortunately, we'll run into a `ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package`.

We could just install `yeetpylib` locally with `pip`, but in my *lived experience* this arrangement quickly unravels into an unholy nightmare to try to keep the installed version up-to-date, especially in situations where the library's actively being developed side-by-side with an end-script or when you want scripting to be guaranteed-consistent with your source at a particular revision.

Taking this one step further, we could also bundle `yeetpylib` as a PyPi package.
I've had moderate payoff spamming PyPi with little nuggets I want to re-use across projects (like [keyname](https://pypi.org/project/keyname/), [iterpop](https://pypi.org/project/iterpop/), and [iterdub](https://pypi.org/project/iterdub/)).
However, this only works well for well-defined components are one-and-done-able so you can just pin and forget them.
The local install frustrations mentioned above would pair dreadfully with the aperitif of constantly (forgetting to) deploy your latest changes.

## My One Weird Trick (TM): Symlinking

[Soft symlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) are a special kind of file that redirects your operating system to go grab a file (or folder) form somewhere else.
For example, if I had this file tree where `my_symlink` was set up to redirect to `../my_file`

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my_folder
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my_symlink
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my_file
```

and I were to run `cat my_folder/my_symlink` the contents of `my_file` would be printed out.
Because they're a redirect rather than a copy, the contents of `my_symlink` will always be up to date with `my_file` (even if we change it later) without us having to do anything!

As a bonus, because they're basically just a file that stores a path to redirect to they [work good with Git](https://mokacoding.com/blog/symliks-in-git/).
(So long as your redirect path is relative and doesn't stretch outside the scope of your repository.)

Soft symlinks are *very* useful as a get-out-of-jail-free card for Python import errors.
If we symlink `yeetpylib` into all the folders with scripts or notebooks where we want to use it, we can freely
```python
import yeetpylib.calculate_cheug.cheugrify
```
to our heart's content!

Here's what a file tree for `my_yeet_project` might look like with symlinks in place.

```
my_yeet_project
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ binder
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cheuggy_graphs_n_stats.ipynb
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sheeshish_graphs_n_stats.ipynb
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ yeetpylib -> ../yeetpylib
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ postprocessing
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gaggy_bash_shenanigans.sh
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sheesh_n_cheugify_data.py
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ yeetpylib -> ../yeetpylib
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ yeetpylib
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ calculate_cheug.py
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ calculate_sheesh.py
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
```

To set up these soft symlinks, you can jump into the directories you want to read `yeetpylib` from and run
```bash
ln -s ../yeetpylib yeetpylib
```

## Let's Chat

I would love to hear your thoughts on Python project organization!!
I'm really looking to glow-up my wisdom on wholesome, anti-cringe practices in this space.

I started a twitter thread (right below) so we can chat :phone: :phone: :phone:
