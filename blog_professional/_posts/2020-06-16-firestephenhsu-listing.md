This blog post assembles a listing of materials I have found useful in understanding the [#FireStephenHsu](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FireStephenHsu) controversy surrounding Michigan State University's Senior Vice President for Research and Innovation, Stephen Hsu.
I intend to update it periodically as the situation develops.

## Graduate Employee Union Thread

The Graduate Employee Union's statement on twitter appears to have ignited the current outcry over Hsu's leadership position at Michigan State University.
It unpacks concerns from blog posts and video interviews involving Hsu related to
* racism,
* eugenics,
* sexism, and
* conflicts of interest.
